0x14. C - Bit manipulation

Learning Objectives
- General
	- Look for the right source of information without too much help
	- How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

Requirements
- General
	- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
	- Betty style of coding and documentation.
	- The use of global variables is not allowed.
	- No more than 5 functions per file.
	- The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit.
	- All header files should be include guarded.

Tasks
- Mandatory
	- 0-binary_to_uint.c: converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
	- 1-print_binary.c: prints the binary representation of a number.
	- 2-get_bit.c: returns the value of a bit at a given index.
	- 3-set_bit.c: sets the value of a bit to 1 at a givwn index.
	- 4-clear_bit.c: sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
	- 5-flip_bits.c: returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
