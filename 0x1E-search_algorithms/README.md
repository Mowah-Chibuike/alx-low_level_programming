# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Learning Objectives
### General
- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- Your code should use the Betty style.
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are only allowed to use the printf function of the standard library. Any call to another function like strdup, malloc,  is forbidden.
- All your header files should be include guarded

## Tasks
### Mandatory
- 0-linear.c: contains a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm
- 1-binary.c: contains a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm
- 2-O: contains the time complexity of the Linear search algorithm
- 3-O: contains the space complexity of the Linear search algorithm
- 4-O: contains the time complexity of the Binary search algorithm
- 5-O: contains the space complexity of the Binary search algorithm
